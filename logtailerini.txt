Recommendations

	- Take care to set Loglevel for FileLevel = 2 in your MMDVM.ini

	- Also set debug = 0 on each section to avoid irritating output 
	  on the Dashboard

	- At least Python3.7 should be installed

If using DMRHost by BrandMeister-Team

	- If you are using the DMRHost as replacement for MMDVMHost you
	  should enable DMR-ID-Lookup within logtailer.ini by setting the
	  corresponding option = 1 Also take care to configure the filepath
	  to the correct location of your DMRIds.dat.

	- To update the DMRIds.dat file, you can use the script found in
	  scripts-folder.

Configuration of Talkgroup-Textes in "Target"-column

	You will find a file in /html/data called "TG_List.csv" that is a
	comma-separated file of following format:

		MODE,TS,TG,LABEL,URL
		DMR,1,263,DL Multimode BM,
		DMR,2,8021,Pegasus DMR-DL,
		DMR,2,2625,RLP/SL BM,
		YSF,0,1,Local Parrot,
		YSF,0,2,DEV Reflector,
		YSF,0,10,YSF2DMR TG26250,
		YSF,0,40,DL Multimode 263,https://c4fm.ysfreflector.de/Germany/

	First row leave untouched for orientation. The other lines contains
	on first column the DMR-timeslot the TG is used, second column
	contains the talkgroup-number and third column contains the label
	you want to be shown in the target-column of the dashboard. The last
	column can contain an URL to any dashboard or homepage you like to
	point to. If no URL is given, on DMR-Mode the corresponding
	Last-Heard-List for the talkgroup in BrandMeister-Network is linked.

	Please edit this file to your needs. It may change on developer-side
	from time by time so when updating keep a copy of your personal list
	to modify/edit it.

	If you do not want to have this Talkgroup-textes in your dashboard,
	simply remove all but the first line in this file.

Installation Best Practices

	For getting the best user experience it is recommended to configure
	your MMDVMHost and other G4KLX-software with the following parameter:

		FileRotate=0

	This results in having only one logfile for each program and having
	it rotated by your linux-system with logrotate if configured.

	You should also configure your logtailer.ini with

		FileRotate=False

	to have the logtailer in correct behaviour for reading this file.

	To configure log rotation in Linux take a look at
